# BastianPlugin
Repository for channel https://www.youtube.com/@bastiandev/videos

## Installation
*	Check out this repository and copy the whole "Bastian" folder to \your Lyra Game\Plugins\GameFeatures\
*	Set the default map in the project settings to "M_DemoPlane"
*	Add the plugins: "Text 3D", "HttpBlueprint", Blueprint Stats", "Tool Palette for the Widget Editor", "UserToolBoxBasicCommand", "UserToolBoxCore" and "Targeting System", restart
*	Open Project Settings and change "Loading Screen Widget" to your customized version - "W_BA_LoadingScreenHost" in my example
*	[Add "DT_BA_GameplayTags" to "Project Settings/Gameplay Tags/Gameplay Tag Table List" and that path to the Asset Manager - buggy, do not use at the moment until Epics fix]
*	The above data table should work in theory, but does not in practise for plugins: Instead a file PluginTags.ini can be found in the plugin config folder to manage the additional Gameplay Tags
*	Only develop and test the game as "Client"
		
## Lyra base fixes
*	Open GA_Interact from ShooterExplorer and remove the "Hello on press" PrintString node
*	Open ABP_UnarmedAnimLayers. Look bottom right in the Anim Preview Editor and switch to "Edit Defaults". Look for "Jump Fall Land" and change to "MM_Unarmed_Jump_Fall_Land". Do the same for "ABP_UnarmedAnimLayers_Feminine"
